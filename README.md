# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction â€“ Internship Project (Week 2)

## Objective
Build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on:
- Hours Studied
- Attendance Percentage

## Dataset
A small dataset is manually created with the following columns:
- Hours_Studied
- Attendance
- Pass_Fail (1 = Pass, 0 = Fail)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Created and loaded a sample dataset.
2. Visualized the input features.
3. Split data into training and test sets.
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model.
5. Evaluated accuracy and confusion matrix.
6. Predicted outcomes for new student inputs.

## Results
The model accurately classifies pass/fail outcomes and provides a good understanding of how study time and attendance affect student performance.
